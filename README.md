# Soundboard for the Gregorio Álvarez museum 

This repository shows the code for a web page with three sections: 'Instruments', 'Stories', and 'Language'. Each section has a soundboard with audios related to the Mapuche culture. The Mapuche are a group of indigenous inhabitants of south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina.

The web page was created for the Gregorio Álvarez Museum located in Neuquén, Argentina. The objective was to make the exhibits more interactive.

Stories: this soundboard contains typical Mapuche stories in Spanish.
